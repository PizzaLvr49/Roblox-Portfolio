# HitFix - Hitbox Validation System for Roblox

## 📌 Introduction
**HitFix** is a server-side hitbox validation system designed for **Roblox** to prevent hitbox manipulation exploits. It synchronizes hitbox positions between clients and the server, ensuring that hits are verified with server-stored data before being registered.

## ✨ Features
- **Server-side validation** to prevent hitbox manipulation.
- **Timestamp-based hitbox storage** for accurate hit detection.
- **Binary search algorithm** for efficient nearest timestamp retrieval.
- **Automated hitbox cleanup** to optimize performance.
- **Event-driven synchronization** between client and server.

## 📥 Installation
1. Insert the `HitFix` module into `ReplicatedStorage`.
2. Ensure `UpdateLocal` is a **RemoteEvent** in the same folder as the script.
3. Place `Serializer` (if required) inside the script’s directory.
4. Require `HitFix` in your server scripts to manage hitbox validation.

## 🚀 Usage
### 1. **Initialize a Hitbox Register for a Player**
```lua
local HitFix = require(game.ServerScriptService.HitFix)
HitFix:CreateHitBoxRegister(player)
```
This must be called from the server before tracking a player's hitbox.

### 2. **Update Hitbox Position**
```lua
HitFix:UpdateHitBox(player, hitboxCFrame)
```
Stores a new hitbox position on the **server-side**.

### 3. **Validate a Hit**
```lua
local isValid = HitFix:ValidateHit(player, hitPart, clientTimestamp, tolerance)
if isValid then
    print("Hit confirmed!")
else
    print("Hit rejected.")
end
```
Compares client-side and server-side hitboxes to validate if a hit is legitimate.

## ⚙️ Configuration
Modify `StorageTime` in the script to adjust how long hitboxes are stored before deletion:
```lua
self.StorageTime = 1 -- (in seconds)
```
Increasing this allows more history but may impact performance.

## 📌 API Reference
### `HitFix:CreateHitBoxRegister(player: Player)`
- Initializes a register for storing hitbox data.

### `HitFix:UpdateHitBox(player: Player, hitbox: CFrame)`
- Stores the latest hitbox position for the player on the server.

### `HitFix:GetHitBox(player: Player, directory: string)`
- Retrieves the most recent hitbox from a specified directory (`"Local"` or `"Server"`).

### `HitFix:ValidateHit(player: Player, part: BasePart, clientTimestamp: number, tolerance: number) -> boolean`
- Validates a hit by comparing server-side and client-side hitbox positions.

### `HitFix:BinarySearchClosest(timestamps: {number}, target: number) -> number`
- Finds the closest stored timestamp to the client's hit.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- **Issue: "Player has no register, creating one"**
  - Ensure `HitFix:CreateHitBoxRegister(player)` is called before updating hitboxes.
  
- **Issue: "Local Time Doesn’t Exist"**
  - The client timestamp may be out of sync or missing. Check event synchronization.

- **Issue: "Tolerance Too High"**
  - The tolerance value should not exceed `10`. Adjust it to a lower value.
